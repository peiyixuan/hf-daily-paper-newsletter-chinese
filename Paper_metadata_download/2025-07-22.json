To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions.

      "summary": "Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring\nmodels to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In\nparticular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.",

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization.

Despite advances in video large language\nmodels (video LLMs), existing benchmarks inadequately reflect the gap between\nthese models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness\nin video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to\nassess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans.\nVideo-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and\nevaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises\n1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four\nadversarial questions that probe visual and narrative complexity. Our\nevaluation shows a significant gap between video LLMs and human performance.",

      "summary": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce\nspoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an\ninternal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks.

    "title": "STITCH: Simultaneous Thinking and Talking with Chunked Reasoning for\n  Spoken Language Models",
    "summary": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce\nspoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an\ninternal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of\nbaselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those\nbaselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well\non non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models.

Existing\nReinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a\nsingle-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models\ntrained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems\nacross multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual\nfeedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect\ntheir answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training\nmodels with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., \"Let's try again\")\nafter wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn\nreasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement\nlearning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative\nproblem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training\nsetups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn\nperformance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling\nlanguage models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To\nfurther minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while\nencouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures\nthat guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

      "summary": "Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's\n3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with\nsatellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like\nautonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on\nfully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.\nIn this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self\ndistillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View\n(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view\nlocalization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those\nof the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores\ntextureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions\nand reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas\nor limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly\nimproves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative\norientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill\nprovides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view\nlocalization challenges. Code and model can be found at\nhttps://github.com/tongshw/GeoDistill.",

      "summary": "Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for\ndiagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the\nsubtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current\napproaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect\nlocalized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an\nuncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a\nglobal-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity\nand then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach\nemploys evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding\nthe extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression\nmechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement\nstrategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate\nboth contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three\nCT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for\nkidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our\nanalysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial\nbenefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive\nlearning pipeline is implemented.
